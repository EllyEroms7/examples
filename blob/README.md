# React + TypeScript + Vite

This blob was made to improve my shader skills. it is smooth shape with a dynamic gradient that shifts between custom colours. It uses perlin classic noise to enhance its fluid appearance.

## Getting Started

## Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone <the-repo-url>
cd <your-project-folder>
```

```bash
npm install
```

## Customization

You can modify the blob’s appearance by adjusting shader parameters such as:

Gradient Colors – Change uColourStart and uColourEnd in the shader.

Noise Intensity – Adjust noise scale.

Displacement - Control how far the vertices displace.
